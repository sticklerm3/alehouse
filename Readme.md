# alehouse

My custom zsh-plugin for `zsh` inspired by [betterbrew][8a51380c].

`alehouse-zsh-plugin` contains short aliases for homebrew commands. For now I just have the ones from my personal `.aliases` file and those from [betterbrew][8a51380c].

The latest update adds the functionality to `cd` to various Homebrew locations on the filesystem using `hash -d`. To use just `cd` to its hash with `~` preceding the hash. Example:

```sh
$ cd ~taps
/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps
```

If you have the `autocd` option enabled, you can simple enter the folders name with the `~` as a prefix to make things even faster!

```sh
$ ~brche
~/Library/Caches/Homebrew
```

This plugin is for my personal use and is always a work in progress. Feel free to use it, and dont be afraid make suggestions or offer any corrections to any mistakes you might find!

## Example

Without typing full homebrew commands in console, like:

```sh
$ brew install zsh --build-from-source
```

there is more convenient alias:

```sh
$ bifs zsh
```

## Installation

Installation of Alehouse is super easy! I have instructions listed below for use with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh). Otherwise clone this repo somewhere on your systeem, source the `alehouse-plugin.zsh` in your `zshrc` and restart your shell (`source ~/.zshrc`) to begin using!

### oh-my-zsh

1. Go to `oh-my-zsh` plugins directory:

```sh
$ cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
```

2. Clone the repository into a new directory `alehouse` :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sticklerm3/alehouse-zsh-plugin.git alehouse
```

3. Enable `alehouse` plugin by adding to your `.zshrc` configuration file:

```sh
$ plugins=(alehouse)
```

4. Restart your shell.

```sh
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage

To see a list of all available aliases just type `alias` into your terminal prompt.

### Brew every day

The best part of waking up is having shortcuts in your cup! Some of my most used examples are listed below!

| alias       | command                                                                                              |

| `bsd`       | `brew search --desc`                                                                                 |

| `brewup`    | `brew -v update && brew -v upgrade && brew cask upgrade && brew -v cleanup --prune=5 && brew doctor` |
| `tokenizer` | Finds the `token` for an application to name and create a cask.                                      |
